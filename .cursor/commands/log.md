Constraints {
  Always use reverse chronological order.
  Add most recent changes to the top.
  Never log about logging. Avoid logging meta-work; log salient, user-visible changes.
  For each change, follow conventional commit messages, including a body. Example:

  feat(scope): short title
  Body explaining what changed and why.
}

gitChanges() {
  git add .
  git --no-pager diff --cached
}

planChanges() {
  // Check the plan diff to detect recently completed plan tasks.
}

detectChanges() {
  gitChanges |> planChanges |> logDetectedChanges
}
